# Interactive GameBoy COLOR

This project is an interactive experience that allows you to insert games into a GameBoy COLOR and turn it on. Upon turning it on, a .gif and sounds will play. It does not allow you to play a game.

This project was written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Instructions

Before loading the HTML file, make sure you have sound enabled but not too loud.

Click on a game to insert it into the GameBoy COLOR then turn on the console by clicking on the power switch on the right indicated by an arrow. Turn off the console by clicking the power switch again then click on the game again to eject it. Repeat as many times as you wish.

No dragging, only clicking.
